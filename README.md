## jQuery Plugin ‚öôÔ∏è

This project uses a custom jQuery plugin (`script.js`) to create the infinite scrollable contacts list. The plugin allows for easy customization of the total number of contacts and the starting contact ID.

## Customization üõ†Ô∏è

You can customize the behavior of the contact list by modifying the options in the `script.js` file. The available options include the total number of contacts (`totalContacts`) and the starting contact ID (`contactid`).

```javascript
$(document).ready(function () {
    $("#contacts").infiniteScrollContacts({
        totalContacts: 100,
        contactid: 10
    });
});
```

## Infinite Scroll Enchantment ‚ú®

Dynamically creates contact elements with captivating images and text.
An initial burst of 20 contacts welcomes your users.
As they scroll down, more contacts gracefully join the party, while the earlier ones gracefully exit, creating an infinite scroll spectacle.
Impeccable detection of scroll direction orchestrates the ballet of contact additions and retirements.

## Options Magic üé©‚ú®

Behold the plugin's flexibility with these enchanting options:

- `totalContacts`: The grand total of contacts ready to dazzle the screen initially. Defaults to 50.
- `contactid`: The starting ID for your contacts, setting the tone for the show. Defaults to 1.
